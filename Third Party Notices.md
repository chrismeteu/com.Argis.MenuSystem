### **[Proj.Net](https://proj.org/about.html#license)**
All source, data files and other contents of the PROJ package are available under the following terms.  Note that the PROJ 4.3 and earlier was "public domain" as is common with US government work, but apparently this is not a well defined legal term in many countries. Frank Warmerdam placed everything under the following MIT style license because he believed it is effectively the same as public domain, allowing anyone to use the code as they wish, including making proprietary derivatives.

Initial PROJ 4.3 public domain code was put as Frank Warmerdam as copyrigh holder, but he didn't mean to imply he did the work. Essentially all work wa done by Gerald Evenden.
